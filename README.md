Sales and Inventory Management System

- This is a software for small shops which are run by shopkeepers with limited resources and skills. The main aim of this project is to fill the gap between the uneducated local shopkeepers and the over-complicated sales and inventory management systems available.

- This project is aimed towards creating a simple-looking, simple-to-use, user-friendly yet powerful software which would satisfy the needs of the users to a large extent. Keeping the simplicity factor in mind, the project has a front-end and back-end created with Python and MySQL respectively.

- Admin side: An admin can perform the following actions: 

  1. Add a new product to the database, 

  2. Search for a product (using one of product number, category, brand name, or detail of the product), 

  3. Delete a product from the database, 

  4. Update product details,

  5. Access the entire inventory, and

  6. Check Profits / Losses - the Profit/Loss Calculator calculates for the admin the gains / losses made / suffered by selling: 

    i) individual products, 
    ii) categories of products, 
    iii) products of certain brand names, products bought from certain sellers, and even by
    iv) details of the products.

- Customer Side: A customer can perform the following actions: 

  1. "Look through the entire inventory of products",

  2. "Search" for a product by various means (via Product Number, Category, Brand Name, and Detail of the product), and also, 

  3. "Buy" Products - The Buy menu uses very simple terminology so that customers can buy products easily. The product prices include a 10% VAT and customers are also      provided discounts.

- As a Team Head, my responsibilities were:

  1. Designing the Project Synopsis,
  2. Complete structuring, restructuring and improvisation of each module,
  3. Coding the Main Menu,
  4. Coding both the modules which were "common-to-both" sides (admin and customer),
  5. Coding the entire "Customer side",
  6. Coding the Profit / Loss Calculator, and
  7. Debugging each module in the project

*This project did not include a UI
